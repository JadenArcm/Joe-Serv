# Joe's Server?
Heya! Welcome to that one repository that stores a complete addon for a SRB2 server. Pretty ironic, right?

## Notes
- You can compile this! Just download the stuff in the `source` folder, zip it, and play it!
- There can be problems, so if you find one, please post an **issue** about it!
